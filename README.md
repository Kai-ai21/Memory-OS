# Memory Intelligence OS

A long-term AI memory system. The goal is durable, queryable memory for AI agents — storing
what was learned, retrieving it by meaning rather than by keyword, and keeping it coherent as
it grows. Postgres 17 with `pgvector` is the storage substrate.

## Status

**Phase 1, Milestone 1.0 — repository skeleton only.**

There are no product features yet. What exists today is the application factory, the database
engine wiring, two health endpoints, and a green lint/type/test pipeline. The `domain/` and
`application/` packages are intentionally empty; they get filled in from Milestone 1.1 onward.

## Architecture

Four layers. Dependencies point **inward only**.

```
api/          → FastAPI routes and HTTP schemas. Thin, no business logic.
application/  → Use cases. Declares Protocol "ports" for what it needs.
domain/       → Entities, value objects, invariants. Pure Python, zero I/O.
adapters/     → Implements the ports (Postgres, pgvector, embedders, filesystem).
```

The rule: `adapters/` depends on `application/`, never the reverse. `domain/` imports nothing
from the other three layers.

Configuration is read once at the edge (`memoryos.config`). Nothing deeper in the stack reads
`os.environ`.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint        | Purpose                                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/health/live`  | Liveness. Never touches external dependencies.                    |
| `/health/ready` | Readiness. Reports database connectivity and the pgvector version. |

Liveness stays dependency-free on purpose: a database blip should not cause an orchestrator to
kill otherwise-healthy containers. Readiness is the endpoint that checks dependencies, and
returns `503` when the database is unreachable or `pgvector` is not installed.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (dependency resolution and virtualenv management)
- Docker (for Postgres)

## Quickstart

```bash
make up        # start Postgres 17 + pgvector on host port 5433
make install   # uv sync --frozen --extra dev
make check     # ruff + mypy --strict + pytest
make run       # uvicorn on http://localhost:8000
```

Host port `5433` is deliberate, so the container does not collide with a local Postgres on
`5432`.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to override defaults. All settings use the `MEMOS_` prefix.

## Tests

```bash
make test-unit  # unit tests only, no database required
make test       # everything, including integration tests
```

Integration tests are marked `integration` and need Postgres running.

If `/health/ready` reports a null `pgvector_version`, the init script did not run because the
data volume already existed. Reset it:

```bash
docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d
```
